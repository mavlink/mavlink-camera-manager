## How to use it

### 1. Downloading

Download the mavlink-camera-manager binary for your architecture from our [releases](https://github.com/mavlink/mavlink-camera-manager/releases), or build it from sources as [described here](#how-to-build-it)

### 2. Installing:

_note: We recommend GStreamer `1.24.0` or above. Previous versions have thread leaks when using WebRTC. You can check it by running `gst-launch-1.0 --version`. If the required version is not available on your operating system from their official store, follow the recommendations from [here](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/download)_
_note 2: for a docker-based installation, use can use [this folder](master/docker) as an example_

**Linux (Ubuntu-based distros)**

- Install the required runtime dependencies:

```Bash
sudo apt update -y && \
sudo apt install -y --no-install-recommends \
   libgstreamer1.0-0 \
   libgstreamer-plugins-base1.0-0 \
   libgstreamer-plugins-bad1.0-0 \
   libgstrtspserver-1.0-0 \
   gstreamer1.0-x \
   gstreamer1.0-nice
```

- Optionally, put the folder to your Linux `PATH`

**Windows**

- Download the .zip release for Windows from the releases page
- Install the Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2015–2022 ([official instructions here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist?view=msvc-170))
- Make sure gstreamer is installed and added to your PATH. You can download it from [their official website](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/download/#windows)
- Optionally, add the mavlink-camera-manager folder to your system PATH

**macOS**

- Download the .zip release for macOS from the releases page
- Install GStreamer using Homebrew:
```
brew install gstreamer gst-plugins-base gst-plugins-bad gst-plugins-good gst-rtsp-server
```
- Optionally, add the binary's folder to your `PATH`

### 3. Running

After [the installation](#2-installing), the binary can be run by calling it from the terminal, as simple as:

```Bash
mavlink-camera-manager --mavlink=tcpout:0.0.0.0:14000 --verbose
```

At this point, the API should be ready. By default, it's accessible from any computer in the same network at port `6020`, but it is customizable using the `--rest-server` CLI argument.

For more information about the CLI arguments, `mavlink-camera-manager --help` will give a list of accepted parameters for your version.

- Along with the REST API, a simple management interface is available at http://localhost:6020, in which streams can be created and managed:
  ![picture 1](images/management_interface.png)

- For developers, the Swagger UI with documentation for the entire REST API can be found at http://localhost:6020/docs
  ![picture 2](images/swagger_ui.png)

## Quick test guide

The short clip below shows how an H264 UDP stream can be configured using the management interface, and how it can be accessed as a WebRTC stream.

![Creating H264 Usb camera stream and testing it via WebRTC](images/creating_h264_usb_camera_stream_and_testing_via_webrtc.gif)

<!-- TODO: #### Receiving a stream from a video player like VLC -->

#### Receiving a stream from a MAVLink ground control station like QGroundControl

The video should automatically popup if you are using any modern GCS, like QGroundControl, that has support for MAVLink camera messages.

1. Start `mavlink-camera-manager`
2. Start `mavproxy` or `sim_vehicle` with a **TCP server** at `5777` (mavlink-camera-manager's default can be changed via the CLI argument `--mavlink`)
3. Open your Ground Control Station
4. Done

#### Receiving a stream from a GStreamer pipeline

1. Start `mavlink-camera-manager`
2. Run the following pipeline:

- If **RTSP** (any encoding):

```Bash
gstreamer-launch-1.0 rtspsrc location=$RTSP_ADDR latency=0 \
   ! decodebin
   ! fpsdisplaysink sync=false
```

- If **UDP** (H264 only):

```Bash
gstreamer-launch-1.0 udpsrc port=$PORT \
   ! application/x-rtp,payload=96 \
   ! rtph264depay \
   ! avdec_h264 discard-corrupted-frames=true \
   ! videoconvert
   ! fpsdisplaysink sync=false
```

## Project origins

The Mavlink Camera Manager project originated as a personal experiment by [@patrickelectric](github.com/patrickelectric/), driven by the need to address a critical challenge in remotely operated vehicles – effectively managing and providing camera streams to the topside computer. At the time, there was a noticeable absence of open-source alternatives, which motivated the project's inception.

Over time, the project gained recognition and was officially embraced by [**Blue Robotics**](https://github.com/bluerobotics) as a core development effort. It became an integral part of their operating system, BlueOS, and was widely distributed worldwide. The adoption of the Mavlink Camera Manager by Blue Robotics served as a testament to its capabilities and value.

Due to increasing interest from other developers and integrators, the project was transferred to the [**MAVLink organization**](https://github.com/mavlink) on May 25, 2023.
