      "description": "Compressed video frame data.\n\nFor packet-based video codecs this data must begin and end on packet boundaries (no partial packets), and must contain enough video packets to decode exactly one image (either a keyframe or delta frame). Note: Foxglove does not support video streams that include B frames because they require lookahead.\n\nSpecifically, the requirements for different `format` values are:\n\n- `h264`\n  - Use Annex B formatted data\n  - Each CompressedVideo message should contain enough NAL units to decode exactly one video frame\n  - Each message containing a key frame (IDR) must also include a SPS NAL unit\n\n- `h265` (HEVC)\n  - Use Annex B formatted data\n  - Each CompressedVideo message should contain enough NAL units to decode exactly one video frame\n  - Each message containing a key frame (IRAP) must also include relevant VPS/SPS/PPS NAL units\n\n- `vp9`\n  - Each CompressedVideo message should contain exactly one video frame\n\n- `av1`\n  - Use the \"Low overhead bitstream format\" (section 5.2)\n  - Each CompressedVideo message should contain enough OBUs to decode exactly one video frame\n  - Each message containing a key frame must also include a Sequence Header OBU"
